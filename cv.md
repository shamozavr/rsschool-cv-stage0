#### Briefly About Myself:
After several years of work as a sales manager, I realized that I did not want to develop in this direction. I tried myself in different areas and settled on front-end development. The more knowlege and practice I had the more interesting the development seemed to me. I found myself enjoying creating new web interfaces, especially when the work right away.
For now my only goal is studying.
